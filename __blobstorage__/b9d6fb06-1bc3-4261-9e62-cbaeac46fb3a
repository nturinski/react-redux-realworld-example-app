# window.fetch polyfill

The `fetch()` function is a Promise-based mechanism for programmatically making
web requests in the browser. This project is a polyfill that implements a subset
of the standard [Fetch specification][], enough to make `fetch` a viable
replacement for most uses of XMLHttpRequest in traditional web applications.

This project adheres to the [Open Code of Conduct][]. By participating, you are
expected to uphold this code.

## Read this first

* If you believe you found a bug with how `fetch` behaves in Chrome or Firefox,
  please **don't open an issue in this repository**. This project is a
  _polyfill_, and since Chrome and Firefox both implement the `window.fetch`
  function natively, no code from this project actually takes any effect in
  these browsers. See [Browser support](#browser-support) for detailed
  information.

* If you have trouble **making a request to another domain** (a different
  subdomain or port number also constitutes another domain), please familiarize
  yourself with all the intricacies and limitations of [CORS][] requests.
  Because CORS requires participation of the server by implementing specific
  HTTP response headers, it is often nontrivial to set up or debug. CORS is
  exclusively handled by the browser's internal mechanisms which this polyfill
  cannot influence.

* If you have trouble **maintaining the user's session** or [CSRF][] protection
  through `fetch` requests, please ensure that you've read and understood the
  [Sending cookies](#sending-cookies) section. `fetch` doesn't send cookies
  unless you ask it to.

* This project **doesn't work under Node.js environments**. It's meant for web
  browsers only. You should ensure that your application doesn't try to package
  and run this on the server.

* If you have an idea for a new feature of `fetch`, **submit your feature
  requests** to the [specification's repository](https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues).
  We only add features and APIs that are part of the [Fetch specification][].

## Installation

* `npm install whatwg-fetch --save`; or

* `bower install fetch`; or

* `yarn add whatwg-fetch`.

You will also need a Promise polyfill for [older browsers](http://caniuse.com/#feat=promises).
We recommend [taylorhakes/promise-polyfill](https://github.com/taylorhakes/promise-polyfill)
for its small size and Promises/A+ compatibility.

For use with webpack, add this package in the `entry` configuration option
before your application entry point:

```javascript
entry: ['whatwg-fetch', ...]
```

For Babel and ES2015+, make sure to import the file:

```javascript
import 'whatwg-fetch'
```

## Usage

For a more comprehensive API reference that this polyfill supports, refer to
https://github.github.io/fetch/.

### HTML

```javascript
fetch('/users.html')
  .then(function(response) {
    return response.text()
  }).then(function(body) {
    document.body.innerHTML = body
  })
```

### JSON

```javascript
fetch('/users.json')
  .then(function(response) {
    return response.json()
  }).then(function(json) {
    console.log('parsed json', json)
  }).catch(function(ex) {
    console.log('parsing failed', ex)
  })
```

### Response metadata

```javascript
fetch('/users.json').then(function(response) {
  console.log(response.headers.get('Content-Type'))
  console.log(response.headers.get('Date'))
  console.log(response.status)
  console.log(response.statusText)
})
```

### Post form

```javascript
var form = document.querySelector('form')

fetch('/users', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: new FormData(form)
})
```

### Post JSON

```javascript
fetch('/users', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    name: 'Hubot',
    login: 'hubot',
  })
})
```

### File upload

```javascript
var input = document.querySelector('input[type="file"]')

var data = new FormData()
data.append('file', input.files[0])
data.append('user', 'hubot')

fetch('/avatars', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: data
})
```

### Caveats

The `fetch` specification differs from `jQuery.ajax()` in mainly two ways that
bear keeping in mind:

* The Promise returned from `fetch()` **won't reject on HTTP error status**
  even if the response is an HTTP 404 or 500. Instead, it will resolve normally,
  and it will only reject on network failure or if anything prevented the
  request from completing.

* By default, `fetch` **won't send or receive any cookies** from the server,
  resulting in unauthenticated requests if the site relies on maintaining a user
  session. See [Sending cookies](#sending-cookies) for how to opt into cookie
  handling.

#### Handling HTTP error statuses

To have `fetch` Promise reject on HTTP error statuses, i.e. on any non-2xx
status, define a custom response handler:

```javascript
function checkStatus(response) {
  if (response.status >= 200 && response.status < 300) {
    return response
  } else {
    var error = new Error(response.statusText)
    error.response = response
    throw error
  }
}

function parseJSON(response) {
  return response.json()
}

fetch('/users')
  .then(checkStatus)
  .then(parseJSON)
  .then(function(data) {
    console.log('request succeeded with JSON response', data)
  }).catch(function(error) {
    console.log('request failed', error)
  })
```

#### Sending cookies

To automatically send cookies for the current domain, the `credentials` option
must be provided:

```javascript
fetch('/users', {
  credentials: 'same-origin'
})
```

The "same-origin" value makes `fetch` behave similarly to XMLHttpRequest with
regards to cookies. Otherwise, cookies won't get sent, resulting in these
requests not preserving the authentication session.

For [CORS][] requests, use the "include" value to allow sending credentials to
other domains:

```javascript
fetch('https://example.com:1234/users', {
  credentials: 'include'
})
```

#### Receiving cookies

As with XMLHttpRequest, the `Set-Cookie` response header returned from the
server is a [forbidden header name][] and therefore can't be programmatically
read with `response.headers.get()`. Instead, it's the browser's responsibility
to handle new cookies being set (if applicable to the current URL). Unless they
are HTTP-only, new cookies will be available through `document.cookie`.

Bear in mind that the default behavior of `fetch` is to ignore the `Set-Cookie`
header completely. To opt into accepting cookies from the server, you must use
the `credentials` option.

#### Obtaining the Response URL

Due to limitations of XMLHttpRequest, the `response.url` value might not be
reliable after HTTP redirects on older browsers.

The solution is to configure the server to set the response HTTP header
`X-Request-URL` to the current URL after any redirect that might have happened.
It should be safe to set it unconditionally.

``` ruby
# Ruby on Rails controller example
response.headers['X-Request-URL'] = request.url
```

This server workaround is necessary if you need reliable `response.url` in
Firefox < 32, Chrome < 37, Safari, or IE.

## Browser Support

- Chrome
- Firefox
- Safari 6.1+
- Internet Explorer 10+

Note: modern browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Safari contain native
implementations of `window.fetch`, therefore the code from this polyfill doesn't
have any effect on those browsers. If you believe you've encountered an error
with how `window.fetch` is implemented in any of these browsers, you should file
an issue with that browser vendor instead of this project.

 * If a property name is provided for `predicate` the created `_.property`
 * style callback returns the property value of the given element.

 * If a value is also provided for `thisArg` the created `_.matchesProperty`
 * style callback returns `true` for elements that have a matching property
 * value, else `false`.

 * If an object is provided for `predicate` the created `_.matches` style
 * callback returns `true` for elements that have the properties of the given

> Find semver versions in a string: `unicorn 1.0.0` â†’ `1.0.0`


## Install

```
$ npm install --save find-versions
```


## Usage

```js
var findVersions = require('find-versions');

findVersions('unicorn 1.0.0 rainbow v2.3.4+build.1');
//=> ['1.0.0', '2.3.4+build.1']

findVersions('cp (GNU coreutils) 8.22', {loose: true});
//=> ['8.22.0']
```


## API

### findVersions(input, options)

#### input

*Required*  
Type: `string`

#### options.loose

Type: `boolean`  
Default: `false`

Also match non-semver versions like `1.88`.  
They're coerced into semver compliant versions.


## CLI

```
$ npm install --global find-versions
```

```
$ find-versions --help

  Usage
    $ find-versions <string> [--first] [--loose]
    $ echo <string> | find-versions

  Example
    $ find-versions 'unicorns v1.2.3'
    1.2.3

    $ curl --version | find-versions --first
    7.30.0

  Options
    --first  Return the first match
    --loose  Match non-semver versions like 1.88
```

# object.omit [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/object.omit.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/object.omit)

> Return a copy of an object without the given key, or array of keys.

## Install
```bash
npm i object.omit --save-dev
```


## Usage

```js
var omit = require('object.omit');
```

Pass a string `key` to omit:

```js
omit({a: 'a', b: 'b', c: 'c'}, 'a')
//=> { b: 'b', c: 'c' }
```

Pass an array of `keys` to omit:

```js
omit({a: 'a', b: 'b', c: 'c'}, ['a', 'c'])
//=> { b: 'b' }
```

Returns the object if no keys are passed:

```js
omit({a: 'a', b: 'b', c: 'c'})
//=> {a: 'a', b: 'b', c: 'c'}
```

Returns an empty object if no value is passed.

```js
omit()
//=> {}
```

### Other awesome javascript/node.js utils
 * [object.filter](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/object.filter): Create a new object filtered to have only properties for which the callback returns true.
 * [object.pick](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/object.pick): Returns a filtered copy of an object with only the specified keys, like `pick` from lo-dash / underscore.
 * [object.pluck](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/object.pluck): Like pluck from underscore / lo-dash, but returns an object composed of specified properties, with values unmodified from those of the original object.
 * [object.reduce](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/object.reduce): Reduces an object to a value that is the accumulated result of running each property in the object through a callback.
 * [object.defaults](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/object.defaults): Like `extend` but only copies missing properties/values to the target object.

## Runing tests
Install dev dependencies:

```bash
npm i -d && npm test
```

## V8 internals

The hooks to access V8 internalsâ€”including GC and statisticsâ€”are different across the supported versions of V8, therefore NAN provides its own hooks that call the appropriate V8 methods.

### NAN_GC_CALLBACK(callbackname)

Use `NAN_GC_CALLBACK` to declare your callbacks for `Nan::AddGCPrologueCallback()` and `Nan::AddGCEpilogueCallback()`. Your new method receives the arguments `v8::GCType type` and `v8::GCCallbackFlags flags`.

```c++
static Nan::Persistent<Function> callback;

NAN_GC_CALLBACK(gcPrologueCallback) {
  v8::Local<Value> argv[] = { Nan::New("prologue").ToLocalChecked() };
  Nan::MakeCallback(Nan::GetCurrentContext()->Global(), Nan::New(callback), 1, argv);
}

NAN_METHOD(Hook) {
  callback.Reset(To<Function>(args[0]).ToLocalChecked());
  Nan::AddGCPrologueCallback(gcPrologueCallback);
  info.GetReturnValue().Set(info.Holder());
}

The fastest deep equal with ES6 Map, Set and Typed arrays support.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/epoberezkin/fast-deep-equal.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/epoberezkin/fast-deep-equal)
[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/fast-deep-equal.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fast-deep-equal)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/epoberezkin/fast-deep-equal/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/epoberezkin/fast-deep-equal?branch=master)


## Install

```bash
npm install fast-deep-equal
```


## Features

- ES5 compatible
- works in node.js (8+) and browsers (IE9+)
- checks equality of Date and RegExp objects by value.

ES6 equal (`require('fast-deep-equal/es6')`) also supports:
- Maps
- Sets
- Typed arrays


## Usage

```javascript
var equal = require('fast-deep-equal');
console.log(equal({foo: 'bar'}, {foo: 'bar'})); // true
```

To support ES6 Maps, Sets and Typed arrays equality use:

```javascript
var equal = require('fast-deep-equal/es6');
console.log(equal(Int16Array([1, 2]), Int16Array([1, 2]))); // true
```

To use with React (avoiding the traversal of React elements' _owner
property that contains circular references and is not needed when
comparing the elements - borrowed from [react-fast-compare](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-fast-compare)):

```javascript
var equal = require('fast-deep-equal/react');
var equal = require('fast-deep-equal/es6/react');
```

# fs.realpath

A backwards-compatible fs.realpath for Node v6 and above

In Node v6, the JavaScript implementation of fs.realpath was replaced
with a faster (but less resilient) native implementation.  That raises
new and platform-specific errors and cannot handle long or excessively
symlink-looping paths.

This module handles those cases by detecting the new errors and
falling back to the JavaScript implementation.  On versions of Node
prior to v6, it has no effect.

## USAGE

```js
var rp = require('fs.realpath')

// async version
rp.realpath(someLongAndLoopingPath, function (er, real) {
  // the ELOOP was handled, but it was a bit slower
})

// sync version
var real = rp.realpathSync(someLongAndLoopingPath)

// monkeypatch at your own risk!
// This replaces the fs.realpath/fs.realpathSync builtins
rp.monkeypatch()

// un-do the monkeypatching
rp.unmonkeypatch()
```

in-publish
==========

> For background, see [npm#10074](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/10074).

Detect if we were run as a result of `npm publish`. This is intended to allow you to
easily have prepublish lifecycle scripts that don't run when you run `npm install`.

```
$ npm install --save-dev in-publish
in-publish@1.0.0 node_modules/in-publish
```

Then edit your package.json to have:

```json
  "scripts": {
    "prepublish": "in-publish && thing-I-dont-want-on-dev-install || not-in-publish"
  }
```

Now when you run:

```
$ npm install
```
Then `thing-I-dont-want-on-dev-install` won't be run, but...

```
$ npm publish
```
And `thing-I-dont-want-on-dev-install` will be run.

It's worth noting that the `prepublish` lifecycle is _ALSO_ called when you build a tarball, so:

```
$ npm pack
```

Will call your `prepublish` lifecycle, but with the example above,
`thing-I-dont-want-on-dev-install` won't be run.

If you want this, you can use another helper included here:

```json
  "scripts": {
    "prepublish": "not-in-install && thing-I-dont-want-on-dev-install || in-install"
  }
```

The above will run your `thing-I-dont-want-on-dev-install` on `publish` and
on `pack` but not on `install`.

produce an error.

### New features

(2015, etc).

Support for `async`/`await` syntax when `ecmaVersion` is >= 8.

Support for trailing commas in call expressions when `ecmaVersion`
is >= 8.

## 3.3.0 (2016-07-25)

Support for comprehension syntax (which was dropped from the draft
spec) has been removed.

### Fixes

`let` and `yield` are now â€œcontextual keywordsâ€, meaning you can
mostly use them as identifiers in ES5 non-strict code.

A parenthesized class or function expression after `export default` is
now parsed correctly.

### New features

When `ecmaVersion` is set to 7, Acorn will parse the exponentiation
operator (`**`).

The identifier character ranges are now based on Unicode 8.0.0.

This sample hook safeguards topic branches that have been
published from being rewound.

The workflow assumed here is:

 * Once a topic branch forks from "master", "master" is never
   merged into it again (either directly or indirectly).

 * Once a topic branch is fully cooked and merged into "master",
   it is deleted.  If you need to build on top of it to correct
   earlier mistakes, a new topic branch is created by forking at
   the tip of the "master".  This is not strictly necessary, but
   it makes it easier to keep your history simple.

 * Whenever you need to test or publish your changes to topic
   branches, merge them into "next" branch.

The script, being an example, hardcodes the publish branch name
to be "next", but it is trivial to make it configurable via
$GIT_DIR/config mechanism.

With this workflow, you would want to know:

(1) ... if a topic branch has ever been merged to "next".  Young
    topic branches can have stupid mistakes you would rather
    clean up before publishing, and things that have not been
    merged into other branches can be easily rebased without
    affecting other people.  But once it is published, you would
    not want to rewind it.

(2) ... if a topic branch has been fully merged to "master".
    Then you can delete it.  More importantly, you should not
    build on top of it -- other people may already want to
    change things related to the topic as patches against your
    "master", so if you need further changes, it is better to
    fork the topic (perhaps with the same name) afresh from the
    tip of "master".

Let's look at this example:

		   o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "next"
		  /       /           /           /
		 /   a---a---b A     /           /
		/   /               /           /
	       /   /   c---c---c---c B         /
	      /   /   /             \         /
	     /   /   /   b---b C     \       /
	    /   /   /   /             \     /
    ---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "master"


A, B and C are topic branches.

 * A has one fix since it was merged up to "next".

 * B has finished.  It has been fully merged up to "master" and "next",
   and is ready to be deleted.

 * C has not merged to "next" at all.

We would want to allow C to be rebased, refuse A, and encourage
B to be deleted.

To compute (1):

	git rev-list ^master ^topic next
	git rev-list ^master        next

	if these match, topic has not merged in next at all.

To compute (2):

	git rev-list master..topic

	if this is empty, it is fully merged to "master".

Create simple HTTP ETags

This module generates HTTP ETags (as defined in RFC 7232) for use in
HTTP responses.

## Installation

This is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) module available through the
[npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/). Installation is done using the
[`npm install` command](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-npm-packages-locally):

```sh
$ npm install etag
```

## API

<!-- eslint-disable no-unused-vars -->

```js
var etag = require('etag')
```

### etag(entity, [options])

Generate a strong ETag for the given entity. This should be the complete
body of the entity. Strings, `Buffer`s, and `fs.Stats` are accepted. By
default, a strong ETag is generated except for `fs.Stats`, which will
generate a weak ETag (this can be overwritten by `options.weak`).

<!-- eslint-disable no-undef -->

```js
res.setHeader('ETag', etag(body))
```

#### Options

`etag` accepts these properties in the options object.

##### weak

Specifies if the generated ETag will include the weak validator mark (that
is, the leading `W/`). The actual entity tag is the same. The default value
is `false`, unless the `entity` is `fs.Stats`, in which case it is `true`.

## Testing

```sh
$ npm test
```

## Benchmark

```bash
$ npm run-script bench

// AST walker module for Mozilla Parser API compatible trees

// A simple walk is one where you simply specify callbacks to be
// called on specific nodes. The last two arguments are optional. A
// simple use would be
//
//     walk.simple(myTree, {
//         Expression: function(node) { ... }
//     });
//
// to do something with all expressions. All Parser API node types
// can be used to identify node types, as well as Expression and
// Statement, which denote categories of nodes.
//
// The base argument can be used to pass a custom (recursive)
// walker, and state can be used to give this walked an initial
// state.

 * If a property name is provided for `predicate` the created `_.property`
 * style callback returns the property value of the given element.
 *
 * If a value is also provided for `thisArg` the created `_.matchesProperty`
 * style callback returns `true` for elements that have a matching property
 * value, else `false`.
 *
 * If an object is provided for `predicate` the created `_.matches` style
 * callback returns `true` for elements that have the properties of the given
 * object, else `false`.
 *
 * @static
 * @memberOf _
 * @category Array
 * @param {Array} array The array to search.
 * @param {Function|Object|string} [predicate=_.identity] The function invoked
 *  per iteration.
 * @param {*} [thisArg] The `this` binding of `predicate`.
 * @returns {number} Returns the index of the found element, else `-1`.

[![NPM version][npm-img]][npm-url] [![Build Status: Linux][travis-img]][travis-url] [![Build Status: Windows][appveyor-img]][appveyor-url] [![Coverage Status][coveralls-img]][coveralls-url]

Removes all separators from the end of a string.

## Install

```
npm install remove-trailing-separator
```

## Examples

```js
const removeTrailingSeparator = require('remove-trailing-separator');

removeTrailingSeparator('/foo/bar/')   // '/foo/bar'
removeTrailingSeparator('/foo/bar///') // '/foo/bar'

// leaves only/last separator
removeTrailingSeparator('/')    // '/'
removeTrailingSeparator('///')  // '/'

// returns empty string
removeTrailingSeparator('') // ''
```

## Notable backslash, or win32 separator behavior

`\` is considered a separator only on WIN32 systems. All POSIX compliant systems
see backslash as a valid file name character, so it would break POSIX compliance
to remove it there.

In practice, this means that this code will return different things depending on
what system it runs on:

```js
removeTrailingSeparator('\\foo\\')
// UNIX  => '\\foo\\'
// WIN32 => '\\foo'
```

 * Creates a throttled function that only invokes `func` at most once per
 * every `wait` milliseconds. The throttled function comes with a `cancel`
 * method to cancel delayed invocations. Provide an options object to indicate
 * that `func` should be invoked on the leading and/or trailing edge of the
 * `wait` timeout. Subsequent calls to the throttled function return the
 * result of the last `func` call.
 *
 * **Note:** If `leading` and `trailing` options are `true`, `func` is invoked
 * on the trailing edge of the timeout only if the the throttled function is
 * invoked more than once during the `wait` timeout.
 *
 * See [David Corbacho's article](http://drupalmotion.com/article/debounce-and-throttle-visual-explanation)
 * for details over the differences between `_.throttle` and `_.debounce`.

 * @param {Function} func The function to throttle.
 * @param {number} [wait=0] The number of milliseconds to throttle invocations to.
 * @param {Object} [options] The options object.
 * @param {boolean} [options.leading=true] Specify invoking on the leading
 *  edge of the timeout.
 * @param {boolean} [options.trailing=true] Specify invoking on the trailing

 * // invoke `renewToken` when the click event is fired, but not more than once every 5 minutes

> Create a javascript regular expression for matching everything except for the given string.

Please consider following this project's author, [Jon Schlinkert](https://github.com/jonschlinkert), and consider starring the project to show your :heart: and support.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install --save regex-not
```

## Usage

```js
var not = require('regex-not');
```

The main export is a function that takes a string an options object.

```js
not(string[, options]);
```

**Example**

```js
var not = require('regex-not');
console.log(not('foo'));
//=> /^(?:(?!^(?:foo)$).)+$/
```

**Strict matching**

By default, the returned regex is for strictly (not) matching the exact given pattern (in other words, "match this string if it does NOT _exactly equal_ `foo`"):

```js
var re = not('foo');
console.log(re.test('foo'));     //=> false
console.log(re.test('bar'));     //=> true
console.log(re.test('foobar'));  //=> true
console.log(re.test('barfoo'));  //=> true
```

### .create

Returns a string to allow you to create your own regex:

```js
console.log(not.create('foo'));
//=> '(?:(?!^(?:foo)$).)+'
```

### Options

**options.contains**

You can relax strict matching by setting `options.contains` to true (in other words, "match this string if it does NOT _contain_ `foo`"):

```js
var re = not('foo');
console.log(re.test('foo', {contains: true}));     //=> false
console.log(re.test('bar', {contains: true}));     //=> true
console.log(re.test('foobar', {contains: true}));  //=> false
console.log(re.test('barfoo', {contains: true}));  //=> false
```

#
# A generic Bash completion driver script.
#
# This is meant to provide a re-usable chunk of Bash to use for
# "etc/bash_completion.d/" files for individual tools. Only the "Configuration"
# section with tool-specific info need differ. Features:
#
# - support for short and long opts
# - support for knowing which options take arguments
# - support for subcommands (e.g. 'git log <TAB>' to show just options for the
#   log subcommand)
# - does the right thing with "--" to stop options
# - custom optarg and arg types for custom completions
# - (TODO) support for shells other than Bash (tcsh, zsh, fish?, etc.)
#
#
# Examples/design:
#
# 1. Bash "default" completion. By default Bash's 'complete -o default' is
#    enabled. That means when there are no completions (e.g. if no opts match
#    the current word), then you'll get Bash's default completion. Most notably
#    that means you get filename completion. E.g.:
#       $ tool ./<TAB>
#       $ tool READ<TAB>
#
# 2. all opts and subcmds:
#       $ tool <TAB>
#       $ tool -v <TAB>     # assuming '-v' doesn't take an arg
#       $ tool -<TAB>       # matching opts
#       $ git lo<TAB>       # matching subcmds
#
#    Long opt completions are given *without* the '=', i.e. we prefer space
#    separated because that's easier for good completions.
#
# 3. long opt arg with '='
#       $ tool --file=<TAB>
#       $ tool --file=./d<TAB>
#    We maintain the "--file=" prefix. Limitation: With the attached prefix
#    the 'complete -o filenames' doesn't know to do dirname '/' suffixing. Meh.
#
# 4. envvars:
#       $ tool $<TAB>
#       $ tool $P<TAB>
#    Limitation: Currently only getting exported vars, so we miss "PS1" and
#    others.
#
# 5. Defer to other completion in a subshell:
#       $ tool --file $(cat ./<TAB>
#    We get this from 'complete -o default ...'.
#
# 6. Custom completion types from a provided bash function.
#       $ tool --profile <TAB>        # complete available "profiles"

# Debugging this completion:
#   1. Uncomment the "_{{name}}_log_file=..." line.
#   2. 'tail -f /var/tmp/dashdash-completion.log' in one terminal.
#   3. Re-source this bash completion file.

##commondir
=========

Compute the closest common parent directory among an array of directories.

example
=======

dir
---

    > var commondir = require('commondir');
    > commondir([ '/x/y/z', '/x/y', '/x/y/w/q' ])
    '/x/y'

base
----

    > var commondir = require('commondir')
    > commondir('/foo/bar', [ '../baz', '../../foo/quux', './bizzy' ])
    '/foo'

methods
=======

var commondir = require('commondir');

commondir(absolutePaths)
------------------------

Compute the closest common parent directory for an array `absolutePaths`.

commondir(basedir, relativePaths)
---------------------------------

Compute the closest common parent directory for an array `relativePaths` which
will be resolved for each `dir` in `relativePaths` according to:
`path.resolve(basedir, dir)`.

installation
============

Using [npm](http://npmjs.org), just do:

    npm install commondir

> Array-slice method. Slices `array` from the `start` index up to, but not including, the `end` index.

Please consider following this project's author, [Jon Schlinkert](https://github.com/jonschlinkert), and consider starring the project to show your :heart: and support.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install --save array-slice
```

This function is used instead of `Array#slice` to support node lists in IE < 9 and to ensure dense arrays are returned. This is also faster than native slice in some cases.

## Usage

```js
var slice = require('array-slice');
var arr = ['a', 'b', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j'];

slice(arr, 3, 6);
//=> ['e', 'f', 'g']
```

# Merge Descriptors

[![NPM Version][npm-image]][npm-url]
[![NPM Downloads][downloads-image]][downloads-url]
[![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url]
[![Test Coverage][coveralls-image]][coveralls-url]

Merge objects using descriptors.

```js
var thing = {
  get name() {
    return 'jon'
  }
}

var animal = {

}

merge(animal, thing)

animal.name === 'jon'
```

## API

### merge(destination, source)

Redefines `destination`'s descriptors with `source`'s.

### merge(destination, source, false)

Defines `source`'s descriptors on `destination` if `destination` does not have
a descriptor by the same name.

> Reduce CSS calc() function to the maximum.

Particularly useful for packages like [rework-calc](https://github.com/reworkcss/rework-calc) or [postcss-calc](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-calc).

## Installation

```console
$ npm install reduce-css-calc
```

## Usage

### `var reducedString = reduceCSSCalc(string, precision)`

```javascript
var reduceCSSCalc = require('reduce-css-calc')

reduceCSSCalc("calc(1 + 1)")
// 2

reduceCSSCalc("calc((6 / 2) - (4 * 2) + 1)")
// -4

reduceCSSCalc("calc(1/3)")
// 0.33333

reduceCSSCalc("calc(1/3)", 10)
// 0.3333333333

reduceCSSCalc("calc(3rem * 2 - 1rem)")
// 5rem

reduceCSSCalc("calc(2 * 50%)")
// 100%

reduceCSSCalc("calc(120% * 50%)")
// 60%

reduceCSSCalc("a calc(1 + 1) b calc(1 - 1) c")
// a 2 b 0 c

reduceCSSCalc("calc(calc(calc(1rem * 0.75) * 1.5) - 1rem)")
// 0.125rem

reduceCSSCalc("calc(calc(calc(1rem * 0.75) * 1.5) - 1px)")
// calc(1.125rem - 1px)

reduceCSSCalc("-moz-calc(100px / 2)")
// 50px

reduceCSSCalc("-moz-calc(50% - 2em)")
// -moz-calc(50% - 2em)
```

See [unit tests](test/index.js) for others examples.

	 * A BasicSourceMapConsumer instance represents a parsed source map which we can
	 * query for information about the original file positions by giving it a file
	 * position in the generated source.
	 *
	 * The first parameter is the raw source map (either as a JSON string, or
	 * already parsed to an object). According to the spec, source maps have the
	 * following attributes:
	 *
	 *   - version: Which version of the source map spec this map is following.
	 *   - sources: An array of URLs to the original source files.
	 *   - names: An array of identifiers which can be referrenced by individual mappings.
	 *   - sourceRoot: Optional. The URL root from which all sources are relative.
	 *   - sourcesContent: Optional. An array of contents of the original source files.
	 *   - mappings: A string of base64 VLQs which contain the actual mappings.
	 *   - file: Optional. The generated file this source map is associated with.
	 *
	 * Here is an example source map, taken from the source map spec[0]:
	 *
	 *     {
	 *       version : 3,
	 *       file: "out.js",
	 *       sourceRoot : "",
	 *       sources: ["foo.js", "bar.js"],
	 *       names: ["src", "maps", "are", "fun"],
	 *       mappings: "AA,AB;;ABCDE;"
	 *     }
	 *
	 * The second parameter, if given, is a string whose value is the URL
	 * at which the source map was found.  This URL is used to compute the
	 * sources array.
	 *
	 * [0]: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1RGAehQwRypUTovF1KRlpiOFze0b-_2gc6fAH0KY0k/edit?pli=1#

	 * An IndexedSourceMapConsumer instance represents a parsed source map which
	 * we can query for information. It differs from BasicSourceMapConsumer in
	 * that it takes "indexed" source maps (i.e. ones with a "sections" field) as
	 * input.
	 *
	 * The first parameter is a raw source map (either as a JSON string, or already
	 * parsed to an object). According to the spec for indexed source maps, they
	 * have the following attributes:
	 *
	 *   - version: Which version of the source map spec this map is following.
	 *   - file: Optional. The generated file this source map is associated with.
	 *   - sections: A list of section definitions.
	 *
	 * Each value under the "sections" field has two fields:
	 *   - offset: The offset into the original specified at which this section
	 *       begins to apply, defined as an object with a "line" and "column"
	 *       field.
	 *   - map: A source map definition. This source map could also be indexed,
	 *       but doesn't have to be.
	 *
	 * Instead of the "map" field, it's also possible to have a "url" field
	 * specifying a URL to retrieve a source map from, but that's currently
	 * unsupported.
	 *
	 * Here's an example source map, taken from the source map spec[0], but
	 * modified to omit a section which uses the "url" field.
	 *
	 *  {
	 *    version : 3,
	 *    file: "app.js",
	 *    sections: [{
	 *      offset: {line:100, column:10},
	 *      map: {
	 *        version : 3,
	 *        file: "section.js",
	 *        sources: ["foo.js", "bar.js"],
	 *        names: ["src", "maps", "are", "fun"],
	 *        mappings: "AAAA,E;;ABCDE;"
	 *      }
	 *    }],
	 *  }
	 *
	 * The second parameter, if given, is a string whose value is the URL
	 * at which the source map was found.  This URL is used to compute the
	 * sources array.
	 *
	 * [0]: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1RGAehQwRypUTovF1KRlpiOFze0b-_2gc6fAH0KY0k/edit#heading=h.535es3xeprgt

> Extend an object with the properties of additional objects. node.js/javascript util.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

```sh
$ npm i extend-shallow --save
```

## Usage

```js
var extend = require('extend-shallow');

extend({a: 'b'}, {c: 'd'})
//=> {a: 'b', c: 'd'}
```

Pass an empty object to shallow clone:

```js
var obj = {};
extend(obj, {a: 'b'}, {c: 'd'})
//=> {a: 'b', c: 'd'}
```

Generate code for Pug attributes

[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/pugjs/pug-attrs/master.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/pugjs/pug-attrs)
[![Dependencies Status](https://david-dm.org/pugjs/pug/status.svg?path=packages/pug-attrs)](https://david-dm.org/pugjs/pug?path=packages/pug-attrs)
[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/pug-attrs.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/pug-attrs)

## Installation

    npm install pug-attrs

## Usage

```js
var compileAttrs = require('pug-attrs');
```

### `compileAttrs(attrs, options)`

Compile `attrs` to a JavaScript string that evaluates to the attributes in the desired format.

`options` MUST include the following properties:

- `terse`: whether or not to use HTML5-style terse boolean attributes
- `runtime`: callback that takes a runtime function name and returns the source code that will evaluate to that function at runtime
- `format`: output format; must be `html` or `object`

`attrs` is an array of attributes, with each attribute having the form of `{ name, val, mustEscape }`. `val` represents a JavaScript string that evaluates to the value of the attribute, either statically or dynamically.

```js
var compileAttrs = require('pug-attrs');
var pugRuntime = require('pug-runtime');

function getBaz () { return 'baz<>'; }

var attrs = [
  {name: 'foo',  val: '"bar"',    mustEscape: true },
  {name: 'baz',  val: 'getBaz()', mustEscape: true },
  {name: 'quux', val: true,       mustEscape: false}
];
var result, finalResult;

// HTML MODE
result = compileAttrs(attrs, {
  terse:   true,
  format:  'html',
  runtime: function (name) { return 'pugRuntime.' + name; }
});
//=> '" foo=\\"bar\\"" + pugRuntime.attr("baz", getBaz(), true, true) + " quux"'

finalResult = Function('pugRuntime, getBaz',
  'return (' + result + ');'
);
finalResult(pugRuntime, getBaz);
// => ' foo="bar" baz="baz&lt;&gt;" quux'

// OBJECT MODE
result = compileAttrs(attrs, {
  terse:   true,
  format:  'object',
  runtime: function (name) { return 'pugRuntime.' + name; }
});
//=> '{"foo": "bar","baz": pugRuntime.escape(getBaz()),"quux": true}'

finalResult = Function('pugRuntime, getBaz',
  'return (' + result + ');'
);
finalResult(pugRuntime, getBaz);
//=> { foo: 'bar', baz: 'baz&lt;&gt;', quux: true }
```

Extend like a boss

xtend is a basic utility library which allows you to extend an object by appending all of the properties from each object in a list. When there are identical properties, the right-most property takes precedence.

## Examples

```js
var extend = require("xtend")

// extend returns a new object. Does not mutate arguments
var combination = extend({
    a: "a",
    b: "c"
}, {
    b: "b"
})
// { a: "a", b: "b" }
```

***Node-core streams for userland***

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/readable-stream.png?downloads=true&downloadRank=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/readable-stream/)
[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm-dl/readable-stream.png&months=6&height=3)](https://nodei.co/npm/readable-stream/)

This package is a mirror of the Streams2 and Streams3 implementations in Node-core.

If you want to guarantee a stable streams base, regardless of what version of Node you, or the users of your libraries are using, use **readable-stream** *only* and avoid the *"stream"* module in Node-core.

**readable-stream** comes in two major versions, v1.0.x and v1.1.x. The former tracks the Streams2 implementation in Node 0.10, including bug-fixes and minor improvements as they are added. The latter tracks Streams3 as it develops in Node 0.11; we will likely see a v1.2.x branch for Node 0.12.

**readable-stream** uses proper patch-level versioning so if you pin to `"~1.0.0"` youâ€™ll get the latest Node 0.10 Streams2 implementation, including any fixes and minor non-breaking improvements. The patch-level versions of 1.0.x and 1.1.x should mirror the patch-level versions of Node-core releases. You should prefer the **1.0.x** releases for now and when youâ€™re ready to start using Streams3, pin to `"~1.1.0"`

Overview [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lydell/source-map-resolve.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lydell/source-map-resolve)
========

Resolve the source map and/or sources for a generated file.

```js
var sourceMapResolve = require("source-map-resolve")
var sourceMap        = require("source-map")

var code = [
  "!function(){...}();",
  "/*# sourceMappingURL=foo.js.map */"
].join("\n")

sourceMapResolve.resolveSourceMap(code, "/js/foo.js", fs.readFile, function(error, result) {
  if (error) {
    return notifyFailure(error)
  }
  result
  // {
  //   map: {file: "foo.js", mappings: "...", sources: ["/coffee/foo.coffee"], names: []},
  //   url: "/js/foo.js.map",
  //   sourcesRelativeTo: "/js/foo.js.map",
  //   sourceMappingURL: "foo.js.map"
  // }

  sourceMapResolve.resolveSources(result.map, result.sourcesRelativeTo, fs.readFile, function(error, result) {
    if (error) {
      return notifyFailure(error)
    }
    result
    // {
    //   sourcesResolved: ["/coffee/foo.coffee"],
    //   sourcesContent: ["<contents of /coffee/foo.coffee>"]
    // }
  })
})

sourceMapResolve.resolve(code, "/js/foo.js", fs.readFile, function(error, result) {
  if (error) {
    return notifyFailure(error)
  }
  result
  // {
  //   map: {file: "foo.js", mappings: "...", sources: ["/coffee/foo.coffee"], names: []},
  //   url: "/js/foo.js.map",
  //   sourcesRelativeTo: "/js/foo.js.map",
  //   sourceMappingURL: "foo.js.map",
  //   sourcesResolved: ["/coffee/foo.coffee"],
  //   sourcesContent: ["<contents of /coffee/foo.coffee>"]
  // }
  result.map.sourcesContent = result.sourcesContent
  var map = new sourceMap.sourceMapConsumer(result.map)
  map.sourceContentFor("/coffee/foo.coffee")
  // "<contents of /coffee/foo.coffee>"
})
```


Installation
============

- `npm install source-map-resolve`
- `bower install source-map-resolve`
- `component install lydell/source-map-resolve`

Works with CommonJS, AMD and browser globals, through UMD.

Note: This module requires `setImmediate` and `atob`.
Use polyfills if needed, such as:

- <https://github.com/NobleJS/setImmediate>
- <https://github.com/davidchambers/Base64.js>


Usage
=====

### `sourceMapResolve.resolveSourceMap(code, codeUrl, read, callback)` ###

- `code` is a string of code that may or may not contain a sourceMappingURL
  comment. Such a comment is used to resolve the source map.
- `codeUrl` is the url to the file containing `code`. If the sourceMappingURL
  is relative, it is resolved against `codeUrl`.
- `read(url, callback)` is a function that reads `url` and responds using
  `callback(error, content)`. In Node.js you might want to use `fs.readFile`,
  while in the browser you might want to use an asynchronus `XMLHttpRequest`.
- `callback(error, result)` is a function that is invoked with either an error
  or `null` and the result.

The result is an object with the following properties:

- `map`: The source map for `code`, as an object (not a string).
- `url`: The url to the source map. If the source map came from a data uri,
  this property is `null`, since then there is no url to it.
- `sourcesRelativeTo`: The url that the sources of the source map are relative
  to. Since the sources are relative to the source map, and the url to the
  source map is provided as the `url` property, this property might seem
  superfluos. However, remember that the `url` property can be `null` if the
  source map came from a data uri. If so, the sources are relative to the file
  containing the data uriâ€”`codeUrl`. This property will be identical to the
  `url` property or `codeUrl`, whichever is appropriate. This way you can
  conveniently resolve the sources without having to think about where the
  source map came from.
- `sourceMappingURL`: The url of the sourceMappingURL comment in `code`.

If `code` contains no sourceMappingURL, the result is `null`.

### `sourceMapResolve.resolveSources(map, mapUrl, read, [options], callback)` ###

- `map` is a source map, as an object (not a string).
- `mapUrl` is the url to the file containing `map`. Relative sources in the
  source map, if any, are resolved against `mapUrl`.
- `read(url, callback)` is a function that reads `url` and responds using
  `callback(error, content)`. In Node.js you might want to use `fs.readFile`,
  while in the browser you might want to use an asynchronus `XMLHttpRequest`.
- `options` is an optional object with any of the following properties:
  - `sourceRoot`: Override the `sourceRoot` property of the source map, which
    might only be relevant when resolving sources in the browser. This lets you
    bypass it when using the module outside of a browser, if needed. Pass a
    string to replace the `sourceRoot` property with, or `false` to ignore it.
    Defaults to `undefined`.
- `callback(error, result)` is a function that is invoked with either an error
  or `null` and the result.

The result is an object with the following properties:

- `sourcesResolved`: The same as `map.sources`, except all the sources are
  fully resolved.
- `sourcesContent`: An array with the contents of all sources in `map.sources`,
  in the same order as `map.sources`. If getting the contents of a source fails,
  an error object is put into the array instead.

### `sourceMapResolve.resolve(code, codeUrl, read, [options], callback)` ###

The arguments are identical to `sourceMapResolve.resolveSourceMap`, except that
you may also provide the same `options` as in `sourceMapResolve.resolveSources`.

This is a convenience method that first resolves the source map and then its
sources. You could also do this by first calling
`sourceMapResolve.resolveSourceMap` and then `sourceMapResolve.resolveSources`.

The result is identical to `sourceMapResolve.resolveSourceMap`, with the
properties from `sourceMapResolve.resolveSources` merged into it.

There is one extra feature available, though. If `code` is `null`, `codeUrl` is
treated as a url to the source map instead of to `code`, and will be read. This
is handy if you _sometimes_ get the source map url from the `SourceMap: <url>`
header (see the [Notes] section). In this case, the `sourceMappingURL` property
of the result is `null`.


[Notes]: #notes

### `sourceMapResolve.*Sync()` ###

There are also sync versions of the three previous functions. They are identical
to the async versions, except:

- They expect a sync reading function. In Node.js you might want to use
  `fs.readFileSync`, while in the browser you might want to use a synchronus
  `XMLHttpRequest`.
- They throw errors and return the result instead of using a callback.

`sourceMapResolve.resolveSourcesSync` also accepts `null` as the `read`
parameter. The result is the same as when passing a function as the `read
parameter`, except that the `sourcesContent` property of the result will be an
empty array. In other words, the sources arenâ€™t read. You only get the
`sourcesResolved` property. (This only supported in the synchronus version, since
there is no point doing it asynchronusly.)

### `sourceMapResolve.parseMapToJSON(string, [data])` ###

The spec says that if a source map (as a string) starts with `)]}'`, it should
be stripped off. This is to prevent XSSI attacks. This function does that and
returns the result of `JSON.parse`ing whatâ€™s left.

If this function throws `error`, `error.sourceMapData === data`.

### Errors

All errors passed to callbacks or thrown by this module have a `sourceMapData`
property that contain as much as possible of the intended result of the function
up until the error occurred.

Note that while the `map` property of result objects always is an object,
`error.sourceMapData.map` will be a string if parsing that string fails.


Note
====

This module resolves the source map for a given generated file by looking for a
sourceMappingURL comment. The spec defines yet a way to provide the URL to the
source map: By sending the `SourceMap: <url>` header along with the generated
file. Since this module doesnâ€™t retrive the generated code for you (instead
_you_ give the generated code to the module), itâ€™s up to you to look for such a
header when you retrieve the file (should the need arise).


Development
===========

Tests
-----

First off, run `npm install` to install testing modules and browser polyfills.

`npm test` lints the code and runs the test suite in Node.js.

x-package.json5
---------------

package.json, component.json and bower.json are all generated from
x-package.json5 by using [`xpkg`]. Only edit x-package.json5, and remember to
run `xpkg` before commiting!

[`xpkg`]: https://github.com/kof/node-xpkg

Generating the browser version
------------------------------

source-map-resolve.js is generated from source-map-resolve-node.js and
source-map-resolve-template.js. Only edit the two latter files, _not_
source-map-resolve.js! To generate it, run `npm run build`.

 advantage, since only the last 32K of output is copied to the sliding window

TweetNaCl.js Changelog
======================


v0.14.5
-------

* Fixed incomplete return types in TypeScript typings.
* Replaced COPYING.txt with LICENSE file, which now has public domain dedication
  text from The Unlicense. License fields in package.json and bower.json have
  been set to "Unlicense". The project was and will be in the public domain --
  this change just makes it easier for automated tools to know about this fact by
  using the widely recognized and SPDX-compatible template for public domain
  dedication.


v0.14.4
-------

* Added TypeScript type definitions (contributed by @AndSDev).
* Improved benchmarking code.


v0.14.3
-------

Fixed a bug in the fast version of Poly1305 and brought it back.

Thanks to @floodyberry for promptly responding and fixing the original C code:

> "The issue was not properly detecting if st->h was >= 2^130 - 5, coupled with
> [testing mistake] not catching the failure. The chance of the bug affecting
> anything in the real world is essentially zero luckily, but it's good to have
> it fixed."

https://github.com/floodyberry/poly1305-donna/issues/2#issuecomment-202698577


v0.14.2
-------

Switched Poly1305 fast version back to original (slow) version due to a bug.


v0.14.1
-------

No code changes, just tweaked packaging and added COPYING.txt.


v0.14.0
-------

* **Breaking change!** All functions from `nacl.util` have been removed. These
  functions are no longer available:

      nacl.util.decodeUTF8
      nacl.util.encodeUTF8
      nacl.util.decodeBase64
      nacl.util.encodeBase64

  If want to continue using them, you can include
  <https://github.com/dchest/tweetnacl-util-js> package:

      <script src="nacl.min.js"></script>
      <script src="nacl-util.min.js"></script>

  or

      var nacl = require('tweetnacl');
      nacl.util = require('tweetnacl-util');

  However it is recommended to use better packages that have wider
  compatibility and better performance. Functions from `nacl.util` were never
  intended to be robust solution for string conversion and were included for
  convenience: cryptography library is not the right place for them.

  Currently calling these functions will throw error pointing to
  `tweetnacl-util-js` (in the next version this error message will be removed).

* Improved detection of available random number generators, making it possible
  to use `nacl.randomBytes` and related functions in Web Workers without
  changes.

* Changes to testing (see README).


v0.13.3
-------

No code changes.

* Reverted license field in package.json to "Public domain".

* Fixed typo in README.


v0.13.2
-------

* Fixed undefined variable bug in fast version of Poly1305. No worries, this
  bug was *never* triggered.

* Specified CC0 public domain dedication.

* Updated development dependencies.


v0.13.1
-------

* Exclude `crypto` and `buffer` modules from browserify builds.


v0.13.0
-------

* Made `nacl-fast` the default version in NPM package. Now
  `require("tweetnacl")` will use fast version; to get the original version,
  use `require("tweetnacl/nacl.js")`.

* Cleanup temporary array after generating random bytes.


v0.12.2
-------

* Improved performance of curve operations, making `nacl.scalarMult`, `nacl.box`,
  `nacl.sign` and related functions up to 3x faster in `nacl-fast` version.


v0.12.1
-------

* Significantly improved performance of Salsa20 (~1.5x faster) and
  Poly1305 (~3.5x faster) in `nacl-fast` version.


v0.12.0
-------

* Instead of using the given secret key directly, TweetNaCl.js now copies it to
  a new array in `nacl.box.keyPair.fromSecretKey` and
  `nacl.sign.keyPair.fromSecretKey`.


v0.11.2
-------

* Added new constant: `nacl.sign.seedLength`.


v0.11.1
-------

* Even faster hash for both short and long inputs (in `nacl-fast`).


v0.11.0
-------

* Implement `nacl.sign.keyPair.fromSeed` to enable creation of sign key pairs
  deterministically from a 32-byte seed. (It behaves like
  [libsodium's](http://doc.libsodium.org/public-key_cryptography/public-key_signatures.html)
  `crypto_sign_seed_keypair`: the seed becomes a secret part of the secret key.)

* Fast version now has an improved hash implementation that is 2x-5x faster.

* Fixed benchmarks, which may have produced incorrect measurements.


v0.10.1
-------

* Exported undocumented `nacl.lowlevel.crypto_core_hsalsa20`.


v0.10.0
-------

* **Signature API breaking change!** `nacl.sign` and `nacl.sign.open` now deal
 with signed messages, and new `nacl.sign.detached` and
 `nacl.sign.detached.verify` are available.
 
 Previously, `nacl.sign` returned a signature, and `nacl.sign.open` accepted a
 message and "detached" signature. This was unlike NaCl's API, which dealt with
 signed messages (concatenation of signature and message).
 
 The new API is:

      nacl.sign(message, secretKey) -> signedMessage
      nacl.sign.open(signedMessage, publicKey) -> message | null

 Since detached signatures are common, two new API functions were introduced:
 
      nacl.sign.detached(message, secretKey) -> signature
      nacl.sign.detached.verify(message, signature, publicKey) -> true | false

 (Note that it's `verify`, not `open`, and it returns a boolean value, unlike
 `open`, which returns an "unsigned" message.)

* NPM package now comes without `test` directory to keep it small.


v0.9.2
------

* Improved documentation.
* Fast version: increased theoretical message size limit from 2^32-1 to 2^52
  bytes in Poly1305 (and thus, secretbox and box). However this has no impact
  in practice since JavaScript arrays or ArrayBuffers are limited to 32-bit
  indexes, and most implementations won't allocate more than a gigabyte or so.
  (Obviously, there are no tests for the correctness of implementation.) Also,
  it's not recommended to use messages that large without splitting them into
  smaller packets anyway.


v0.9.1
------

* Initial release
# v1.5.2
- Allow using `"consructor"` as an argument in `memoize` (#998)
- Give a better error messsage when `auto` dependency checking fails (#994)
- Various doc updates (#936, #956, #979, #1002)

# v1.5.1
- Fix issue with `pause` in `queue` with concurrency enabled (#946)
- `while` and `until` now pass the final result to callback (#963)
- `auto` will properly handle concurrency when there is no callback (#966)
- `auto` will now  properly stop execution when an error occurs (#988, #993)
- Various doc fixes (#971, #980)

# v1.5.0

- Added `transform`, analogous to [`_.transform`](http://lodash.com/docs#transform) (#892)
- `map` now returns an object when an object is passed in, rather than array with non-numeric keys. `map` will begin always returning an array with numeric indexes in the next major release. (#873)
- `auto` now accepts an optional `concurrency` argument to limit the number of  running tasks (#637)
- Added `queue#workersList()`, to retrieve the list  of currently running tasks. (#891)
- Various code simplifications (#896, #904)
- Various doc fixes :scroll: (#890, #894, #903, #905, #912)

# v1.4.2

- Ensure coverage files don't get published on npm (#879)

# v1.4.1

- Add in overlooked `detectLimit` method (#866)
- Removed unnecessary files from npm releases (#861)
- Removed usage of a reserved word to prevent :boom: in older environments (#870)

# v1.4.0

- Improve detection of the global object (#804), enabling use in WebWorkers
- `whilst` now called with arguments from iterator (#823)
- `during` now gets called with arguments from iterator (#824)
- Code simplifications and optimizations aplenty ([diff](https://github.com/caolan/async/compare/v1.3.0...v1.4.0))


# v1.3.0

New Features:
- Added `constant`
- Added `asyncify`/`wrapSync` for making sync functions work with callbacks. (#671, #806)
- Added `during` and `doDuring`, which are like `whilst` with an async truth test. (#800)
- `retry` now accepts an `interval` parameter to specify a delay between retries. (#793)
- `async` should work better in Web Workers due to better `root` detection (#804)
- Callbacks are now optional in `whilst`, `doWhilst`, `until`, and `doUntil` (#642)
- Various internal updates (#786, #801, #802, #803)
- Various doc fixes (#790, #794)

Bug Fixes:
- `cargo` now exposes the `payload` size, and `cargo.payload` can be changed on the fly after the `cargo` is created. (#740, #744, #783)


# v1.2.1

Bug Fix:

- Small regression with synchronous iterator behavior in `eachSeries` with a 1-element array.  Before 1.1.0, `eachSeries`'s callback was called on the same tick, which this patch restores.  In 2.0.0, it will be called on the next tick.  (#782)


# v1.2.0

New Features:

- Added `timesLimit` (#743)
- `concurrency` can be changed after initialization in `queue` by setting `q.concurrency`.  The new concurrency will be reflected the next time a task is processed. (#747, #772)

Bug Fixes:

- Fixed a regression in `each` and family with empty arrays that have additional properties. (#775, #777)


# v1.1.1

Bug Fix:

- Small regression with synchronous iterator behavior in `eachSeries` with a 1-element array.  Before 1.1.0, `eachSeries`'s callback was called on the same tick, which this patch restores.  In 2.0.0, it will be called on the next tick.  (#782) 


# v1.1.0

New Features:

- `cargo` now supports all of the same methods and event callbacks as `queue`.
- Added `ensureAsync` - A wrapper that ensures an async function calls its callback on a later tick. (#769)
- Optimized `map`, `eachOf`, and `waterfall` families of functions
- Passing a `null` or `undefined` array to `map`, `each`, `parallel` and families will be treated as an empty array (#667).
- The callback is now optional for the composed results of `compose` and `seq`. (#618)
- Reduced file size by 4kb, (minified version by 1kb) 
- Added code coverage through `nyc` and `coveralls` (#768)

Bug Fixes:

- `forever` will no longer stack overflow with a synchronous iterator (#622)
- `eachLimit` and other limit functions will stop iterating once an error occurs (#754)
- Always pass `null` in callbacks when there is no error (#439)
- Ensure proper conditions when calling `drain()` after pushing an empty data set to a queue (#668)
- `each` and family will properly handle an empty array (#578)
- `eachSeries` and family will finish if the underlying array is modified during execution (#557)
- `queue` will throw if a non-function is passed to `q.push()` (#593)
- Doc fixes (#629, #766)


# v1.0.0

No known breaking changes, we are simply complying with semver from here on out.

Changes:

- Start using a changelog!
- Add `forEachOf` for iterating over Objects (or to iterate Arrays with indexes available) (#168 #704 #321)

- Better support for require.js (#527)
- Throw if queue created with concurrency `0` (#714)
- Fix unneeded iteration in `queue.resume()` (#758)
- Guard against timer mocking overriding `setImmediate` (#609 #611)
- Miscellaneous doc fixes (#542 #596 #615 #628 #631 #690 #729)
- Use single noop function internally (#546)
- Optimize internal `_each`, `_map` and `_keys` functions.

[Vinyl][vinyl] adapter for the file system.

## What is Vinyl?

[Vinyl][vinyl] is a very simple metadata object that describes a file. When you think of a file, two attributes come to mind: `path` and `contents`. These are the main attributes on a [Vinyl][vinyl] object. A file does not necessarily represent something on your computerâ€™s file system. You have files on S3, FTP, Dropbox, Box, CloudThingly.io and other services. [Vinyl][vinyl] can be used to describe files from all of these sources.

## What is a Vinyl Adapter?

While Vinyl provides a clean way to describe a file, we now need a way to access these files. Each file source needs what I call a "Vinyl adapter". A Vinyl adapter simply exposes a `src(globs)` and a `dest(folder)` method. Each return a stream. The `src` stream produces Vinyl objects, and the `dest` stream consumes Vinyl objects. Vinyl adapters can expose extra methods that might be specific to their input/output medium, such as the `symlink` method `vinyl-fs` provides.

## Usage

```javascript
var map = require('map-stream');
var vfs = require('vinyl-fs');

var log = function(file, cb) {
  console.log(file.path);
  cb(null, file);
};

vfs.src(['./js/**/*.js', '!./js/vendor/*.js'])
  .pipe(map(log))
  .pipe(vfs.dest('./output'));
```

## API

### `src(globs[, options])`

Takes a glob string or an array of glob strings as the first argument and an options object as the second.
Returns a stream of [vinyl] `File` objects.

__Note: UTF-8 BOM will be stripped from all UTF-8 files read with `.src` unless disabled in the options.__

#### Globs

Globs are executed in order, so negations should follow positive globs.

For example:

```js
fs.src(['!b*.js', '*.js'])
```

would not exclude any files, but the following would:

```js
fs.src(['*.js', '!b*.js'])
```

#### Options

##### `options.cwd`

The working directory the folder is relative to.

Type: `String`

Default: `process.cwd()`

##### `options.base`

The folder relative to the cwd. This is used to determine the file names when saving in `.dest()`.

Type: `String`

Default: The part of the path before the glob (if any) begins. For example, `path/to/**/*.js` would resolve to `path/to`. If there is no glob (i.e. a file path with no pattern), then the dirname of the path is used. For example, `path/to/some/file.js` would resolve to `path/to/some`.

##### `options.buffer`

Whether or not you want to buffer the file contents into memory. Setting to `false` will make `file.contents` a paused Stream.

Type: `Boolean`

Default: `true`

##### `options.read`

Whether or not you want the file to be read at all. Useful for stuff like removing files. Setting to `false` will make `file.contents` `null` and will disable writing the file to disk via `.dest()`.

Type: `Boolean`

Default: `true`

##### `options.since`

Only streams files that have been modified since the time specified.

Type: `Date` or `Number`

Default: `undefined`

##### `options.stripBOM`

Causes the BOM to be stripped on UTF-8 encoded files. Set to `false` if you need the BOM for some reason.

Type: `Boolean`

Default: `true`

##### `options.passthrough`

Allows `.src` to be used in the middle of a pipeline (using a duplex stream) which passes through all objects received and adds all files globbed to the stream.

Type: `Boolean`

Default: `false`

##### `options.sourcemaps`

Enables sourcemap support on files passed through the stream.  Will load inline sourcemaps and resolve sourcemap links from files. Uses [gulp-sourcemaps] under the hood.

Type: `Boolean`

Default: `false`

##### `options.followSymlinks` - `true` if you want

Whether or not to recursively resolve symlinks to their targets. Setting to `false` to preserve them as symlinks and make `file.symlink` equal the original symlink's target path.

Type: `Boolean`

Default: `true`

##### other

Any glob-related options are documented in [glob-stream] and [node-glob].
Any through2-related options are documented in [through2].

### `dest(folder[, options])`

Takes a folder path string or a function as the first argument and an options object as the second. If given a function, it will be called with each [vinyl] `File` object and must return a folder path.
Returns a stream that accepts [vinyl] `File` objects, writes them to disk at the folder/cwd specified, and passes them downstream so you can keep piping these around.

Once the file is written to disk, an attempt is made to determine if the `stat.mode`, `stat.mtime` and `stat.atime` of the [vinyl] `File` object differ from the file on the filesystem.
If they differ and the running process owns the file, the corresponding filesystem metadata is updated.
If they don't differ or the process doesn't own the file, the attempt is skipped silently.
__This functionality is disabled on Windows operating systems or any other OS that doesn't support `process.getuid` or `process.geteuid` in node. This is due to Windows having very unexpected results through usage of `fs.fchmod` and `fs.futimes`.__

If the file has a `symlink` attribute specifying a target path, then a symlink will be created.

__Note: The file will be modified after being written to this stream.__
  - `cwd`, `base`, and `path` will be overwritten to match the folder.
  - `stat` will be updated to match the file on the filesystem.
  - `contents` will have it's position reset to the beginning if it is a stream.

#### Options

##### `options.cwd`

The working directory the folder is relative to.

Type: `String`

Default: `process.cwd()`

##### `options.base`

The folder relative to the cwd. This is used to determine the file names when saving in `.dest()`. Can also be a function that takes in a file and returns a folder path.

Type: `String` or `Function`

Default: The `cwd` resolved to the folder path.

##### `options.mode`

The mode the files should be created with.

Type: `Number`

Default: The `mode` of the input file (`file.stat.mode`) if any, or the process mode if the input file has no `mode` property.

##### `options.dirMode`

The mode the directory should be created with.

Type: `Number`

Default: The process `mode`.

##### `options.overwrite`

Whether or not existing files with the same path should be overwritten. Can also be a function that takes in a file and returns `true` or `false`.

Type: `Boolean` or `Function`

Default: `true` (always overwrite existing files)

##### `options.sourcemaps`

Enables sourcemap support on files passed through the stream.  Will write inline soucemaps if specified as `true`.
Specifying a `string` is shorthand for the path option. Uses [gulp-sourcemaps] under the hood.

Examples:

```js
// Write as inline comments
vfs.dest('./', {
  sourcemaps: true
});

// Write as files in the same folder
vfs.dest('./', {
  sourcemaps: '.'
});

// Any other options are passed through to [gulp-sourcemaps]
vfs.dest('./', {
  sourcemaps: {
    path: '.',
    addComment: false,
    includeContent: false
  }
});
```

Type: `Boolean`, `String` or `Object`

Default: `undefined` (do not write sourcemaps)

##### other

Any through2-related options are documented in [through2].

### `symlink(folder[, options])`

Takes a folder path string or a function as the first argument and an options object as the second. If given a function, it will be called with each [vinyl] `File` object and must return a folder path.
Returns a stream that accepts [vinyl] `File` objects, create a symbolic link (i.e. symlink) at the folder/cwd specified, and passes them downstream so you can keep piping these around.

__Note: The file will be modified after being written to this stream.__
  - `cwd`, `base`, and `path` will be overwritten to match the folder.

#### Options

##### `options.cwd`

The working directory the folder is relative to.

Type: `String`

Default: `process.cwd()`

##### `options.base`

The folder relative to the cwd. This is used to determine the file names when saving in `.symlink()`. Can also be a function that takes in a file and returns a folder path.

Type: `String` or `Function`

Default: The `cwd` resolved to the folder path.

##### `options.dirMode`

The mode the directory should be created with.

Type: `Number`

Default: The process mode.

##### other

# align-text [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/align-text.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/align-text)  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jonschlinkert/align-text.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/jonschlinkert/align-text)

> Align the text in a string.

**Examples**

Align text values in an array:

```js
align([1, 2, 3, 100]);
//=> ['  1', '  2', '  3', '100']
```

Or [do stuff like this](./example.js):

[![screen shot 2015-06-09 at 2 08 34 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/383994/8051597/7b716fbc-0e4c-11e5-9aef-4493fd22db58.png)](./example.js)

Visit [the example](./example.js) to see how this works.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

```sh
$ npm i align-text --save
```

## Usage

```js
var align = require('align-text');
align(text, callback_function_or_integer);
```

**Params**

* `text` can be a **string or array**. If a string is passed, a string will be returned. If an array is passed, an array will be returned.
* `callback|integer`: if an integer, the text will be indented by that amount. If a function, it must return an integer representing the amount of leading indentation to use as `align` loops over each line.

**Example**

```js
align(text, 4);
```

Would align:

```
abc
abc
abc
```

To:

```
    abc
    abc
    abc
```

## callback

### params

The callback is used to determine the indentation of each line and gets the following params:

* `len` the length of the "current" line
* `longest` the length of the longest line
* `line` the current line (string) being aligned
* `lines` the array of all lines

### return

The callback may return:

* an integer that represents the number of spaces to use for padding,
* or an object with the following properties:
  - `indent`: **{Number}** the amount of indentation to use. Default is `0` when an object is returned.
  - `character`: **{String}** the character to use for indentation. Default is `''` (empty string) when an object is returned.
  - `prefix`: **{String}** leading characters to use at the beginning of each line. `''` (empty string) when an object is returned.

**Integer example:**

```js
// calculate half the difference between the length
// of the current line and the longest line
function centerAlign(len, longest, line, lines) {
  return Math.floor((longest - len) / 2);
}
```

**Object example:**

```js
function centerAlign(len, longest, line, lines) {
  return {
    character: '\t',
    indent: Math.floor((longest - len) / 2),
    prefix: '~ ',
  }
}
```

## Usage examples

### Center align

Using the `centerAlign` function from above:

```js
align(text, centerAlign);
```

Would align this text:

```js
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
consectetur adipiscin
elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididun
ut labore et dolor
magna aliqua. Ut enim ad mini
veniam, quis
```

Resulting in this:

```
     Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
        consectetur adipiscing
elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
         ut labore et dolore
    magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim
             veniam, quis
```

**Customize**

If you wanted to add more padding on the left, just pass the number in the callback.

For example, to add 4 spaces before every line:

```js
function centerAlign(len, longest, line, lines) {
  return 4 + Math.floor((longest - len) / 2);
}
```

Would result in:

```
         Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
            consectetur adipiscing
    elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
             ut labore et dolore
        magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim
                 veniam, quis
```

### Bullets

```js
align(text, function (len, max, line, lines) {
  return {prefix: ' - '};
});
```

Would return:

```
- Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
- consectetur adipiscing
- elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
- ut labore et dolore
- magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim
- veniam, quis
```

### Different indent character

```js
align(text, function (len, max, line, lines) {
  return { 
    indent: Math.floor((max - len) / 2), 
    character: '~', 
  };
});
```

Would return

```
~~~~~Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
~~~~~~~~consectetur adipiscing
elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
~~~~~~~~~ut labore et dolore
~~~~magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim
~~~~~~~~~~~~~veniam, quis
```

Extend like a boss

xtend is a basic utility library which allows you to extend an object by appending all of the properties from each object in a list. When there are identical properties, the right-most property takes precedence.

## Examples

```js
var extend = require("xtend")

// extend returns a new object. Does not mutate arguments
var combination = extend({
    a: "a",
    b: "c"
}, {
    b: "b"
})
// { a: "a", b: "b" }
```

## Install

```bash
npm install emojis-list --save
```

If you want to use in the browser (powered by [Browserify](http://browserify.org/)):

```bash
bower install emojis-list --save
```

and later link in your HTML:

```html
<script src="bower_components/emojis-list/dist/emojis-list.js"></script>
```

## Usage

```
var emojis = require('emojis-list');
console.log(emojis[0]);
// => ðŸ€„
```

# lodash.isarguments v3.1.0

The [lodash](https://lodash.com/) method `_.isArguments` exported as a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) module.

## Installation

Using npm:
```bash
$ {sudo -H} npm i -g npm
$ npm i --save lodash.isarguments
```

In Node.js:
```js
var isArguments = require('lodash.isarguments');
```

# Emitter [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/component/emitter.png)](https://travis-ci.org/component/emitter)

  Event emitter component.

## Installation

```
$ component install component/emitter
```

## API

### Emitter(obj)

  The `Emitter` may also be used as a mixin. For example
  a "plain" object may become an emitter, or you may
  extend an existing prototype.

  As an `Emitter` instance:

```js
var Emitter = require('emitter');
var emitter = new Emitter;
emitter.emit('something');
```

  As a mixin:

```js
var Emitter = require('emitter');
var user = { name: 'tobi' };
Emitter(user);

user.emit('im a user');
```

  As a prototype mixin:

```js
var Emitter = require('emitter');
Emitter(User.prototype);
```

### Emitter#on(event, fn)

  Register an `event` handler `fn`.

### Emitter#once(event, fn)

  Register a single-shot `event` handler `fn`,
  removed immediately after it is invoked the
  first time.

### Emitter#off(event, fn)

  * Pass `event` and `fn` to remove a listener.
  * Pass `event` to remove all listeners on that event.
  * Pass nothing to remove all listeners on all events.

### Emitter#emit(event, ...)

  Emit an `event` with variable option args.

### Emitter#listeners(event)

  Return an array of callbacks, or an empty array.

### Emitter#hasListeners(event)

  Check if this emitter has `event` handlers.

Extend like a boss

xtend is a basic utility library which allows you to extend an object by appending all of the properties from each object in a list. When there are identical properties, the right-most property takes precedence.

## Examples

```js
var extend = require("xtend")

// extend returns a new object. Does not mutate arguments
var combination = extend({
    a: "a",
    b: "c"
}, {
    b: "b"
})
// { a: "a", b: "b" }
```

# dateformat

A node.js package for Steven Levithan's excellent [dateFormat()][dateformat] function.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/felixge/node-dateformat.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/felixge/node-dateformat)

## Modifications

* Removed the `Date.prototype.format` method. Sorry folks, but extending native prototypes is for suckers.
* Added a `module.exports = dateFormat;` statement at the bottom
* Added the placeholder `N` to get the ISO 8601 numeric representation of the day of the week

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install dateformat
$ dateformat --help
```

## Usage

As taken from Steven's post, modified to match the Modifications listed above:
```js
    var dateFormat = require('dateformat');
    var now = new Date();

    // Basic usage
    dateFormat(now, "dddd, mmmm dS, yyyy, h:MM:ss TT");
    // Saturday, June 9th, 2007, 5:46:21 PM

    // You can use one of several named masks
    dateFormat(now, "isoDateTime");
    // 2007-06-09T17:46:21

    // ...Or add your own
    dateFormat.masks.hammerTime = 'HH:MM! "Can\'t touch this!"';
    dateFormat(now, "hammerTime");
    // 17:46! Can't touch this!

    // When using the standalone dateFormat function,
    // you can also provide the date as a string
    dateFormat("Jun 9 2007", "fullDate");
    // Saturday, June 9, 2007

    // Note that if you don't include the mask argument,
    // dateFormat.masks.default is used
    dateFormat(now);
    // Sat Jun 09 2007 17:46:21

    // And if you don't include the date argument,
    // the current date and time is used
    dateFormat();
    // Sat Jun 09 2007 17:46:22

    // You can also skip the date argument (as long as your mask doesn't
    // contain any numbers), in which case the current date/time is used
    dateFormat("longTime");
    // 5:46:22 PM EST

    // And finally, you can convert local time to UTC time. Simply pass in
    // true as an additional argument (no argument skipping allowed in this case):
    dateFormat(now, "longTime", true);
    // 10:46:21 PM UTC

    // ...Or add the prefix "UTC:" or "GMT:" to your mask.
    dateFormat(now, "UTC:h:MM:ss TT Z");
    // 10:46:21 PM UTC

    // You can also get the ISO 8601 week of the year:
    dateFormat(now, "W");
    // 42

    // and also get the ISO 8601 numeric representation of the day of the week:
    dateFormat(now,"N");
    // 6
```

# Lo-Dash v1.0.2

A utility library delivering consistency, [customization](http://lodash.com/custom-builds), [performance](http://lodash.com/benchmarks), & [extras](http://lodash.com/#features).

## Download

* Lo-Dash builds (for modern environments):<br>
[Development](https://raw.github.com/lodash/lodash/v1.0.2/dist/lodash.js) and
[Production](https://raw.github.com/lodash/lodash/v1.0.2/dist/lodash.min.js)

* Lo-Dash compatibility builds (for legacy and modern environments):<br>
[Development](https://raw.github.com/lodash/lodash/v1.0.2/dist/lodash.compat.js) and
[Production](https://raw.github.com/lodash/lodash/v1.0.2/dist/lodash.compat.min.js)

* Underscore compatibility builds:<br>
[Development](https://raw.github.com/lodash/lodash/v1.0.2/dist/lodash.underscore.js) and
[Production](https://raw.github.com/lodash/lodash/v1.0.2/dist/lodash.underscore.min.js)

* For optimal file size, [create a custom build](http://lodash.com/custom-builds) with only the features you need

## Dive in

Weâ€™ve got [API docs](http://lodash.com/docs), [benchmarks](http://lodash.com/benchmarks), and [unit tests](http://lodash.com/tests).

For a list of upcoming features, check out our [roadmap](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/Roadmap).

The full changelog is available [here](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/Changelog).

## Installation and usage

In browsers:

```html
<script src="lodash.js"></script>
```

Using [`npm`](http://npmjs.org/):

```bash
npm install lodash

npm install -g lodash
npm link lodash
```

To avoid potential issues, update `npm` before installing Lo-Dash:

```bash
npm install npm -g
```

In [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [RingoJS v0.8.0+](http://ringojs.org/):

```js
var _ = require('lodash');

// or as a drop-in replacement for Underscore
var _ = require('lodash/lodash.underscore');
```

**Note:** If Lo-Dash is installed globally, run [`npm link lodash`](http://blog.nodejs.org/2011/03/23/npm-1-0-global-vs-local-installation/) in your projectâ€™s root directory before requiring it.

In [RingoJS v0.7.0-](http://ringojs.org/):

```js
var _ = require('lodash')._;
```

In [Rhino](http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/):

```js
load('lodash.js');
```

In an AMD loader like [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/):

```js
require({
  'paths': {
    'underscore': 'path/to/lodash'
  }
},
['underscore'], function(_) {
  console.log(_.VERSION);
});
```

# readable-stream

***Node-core streams for userland***

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/readable-stream.png?downloads=true&downloadRank=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/readable-stream/)
[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm-dl/readable-stream.png?&months=6&height=3)](https://nodei.co/npm/readable-stream/)

This package is a mirror of the Streams2 and Streams3 implementations in Node-core.

If you want to guarantee a stable streams base, regardless of what version of Node you, or the users of your libraries are using, use **readable-stream** *only* and avoid the *"stream"* module in Node-core.

**readable-stream** comes in two major versions, v1.0.x and v1.1.x. The former tracks the Streams2 implementation in Node 0.10, including bug-fixes and minor improvements as they are added. The latter tracks Streams3 as it develops in Node 0.11; we will likely see a v1.2.x branch for Node 0.12.

**readable-stream** uses proper patch-level versioning so if you pin to `"~1.0.0"` youâ€™ll get the latest Node 0.10 Streams2 implementation, including any fixes and minor non-breaking improvements. The patch-level versions of 1.0.x and 1.1.x should mirror the patch-level versions of Node-core releases. You should prefer the **1.0.x** releases for now and when youâ€™re ready to start using Streams3, pin to `"~1.1.0"`

# jsprim: utilities for primitive JavaScript types

This module provides miscellaneous facilities for working with strings,
numbers, dates, and objects and arrays of these basic types.


### deepCopy(obj)

Creates a deep copy of a primitive type, object, or array of primitive types.


### deepEqual(obj1, obj2)

Returns whether two objects are equal.


### isEmpty(obj)

Returns true if the given object has no properties and false otherwise.  This
is O(1) (unlike `Object.keys(obj).length === 0`, which is O(N)).

### hasKey(obj, key)

Returns true if the given object has an enumerable, non-inherited property
called `key`.  [For information on enumerability and ownership of properties, see
the MDN
documentation.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Enumerability_and_ownership_of_properties)

### forEachKey(obj, callback)

Like Array.forEach, but iterates enumerable, owned properties of an object
rather than elements of an array.  Equivalent to:

    for (var key in obj) {
            if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(obj, key)) {
                    callback(key, obj[key]);
            }
    }


### flattenObject(obj, depth)

Flattens an object up to a given level of nesting, returning an array of arrays
of length "depth + 1", where the first "depth" elements correspond to flattened
columns and the last element contains the remaining object .  For example:

    flattenObject({
        'I': {
            'A': {
                'i': {
                    'datum1': [ 1, 2 ],
                    'datum2': [ 3, 4 ]
                },
                'ii': {
                    'datum1': [ 3, 4 ]
                }
            },
            'B': {
                'i': {
                    'datum1': [ 5, 6 ]
                },
                'ii': {
                    'datum1': [ 7, 8 ],
                    'datum2': [ 3, 4 ],
                },
                'iii': {
                }
            }
        },
        'II': {
            'A': {
                'i': {
                    'datum1': [ 1, 2 ],
                    'datum2': [ 3, 4 ]
                }
            }
        }
    }, 3)

becomes:

    [
        [ 'I',  'A', 'i',   { 'datum1': [ 1, 2 ], 'datum2': [ 3, 4 ] } ],
        [ 'I',  'A', 'ii',  { 'datum1': [ 3, 4 ] } ],
        [ 'I',  'B', 'i',   { 'datum1': [ 5, 6 ] } ],
        [ 'I',  'B', 'ii',  { 'datum1': [ 7, 8 ], 'datum2': [ 3, 4 ] } ],
        [ 'I',  'B', 'iii', {} ],
        [ 'II', 'A', 'i',   { 'datum1': [ 1, 2 ], 'datum2': [ 3, 4 ] } ]
    ]

This function is strict: "depth" must be a non-negative integer and "obj" must
be a non-null object with at least "depth" levels of nesting under all keys.


### flattenIter(obj, depth, func)

This is similar to `flattenObject` except that instead of returning an array,
this function invokes `func(entry)` for each `entry` in the array that
`flattenObject` would return.  `flattenIter(obj, depth, func)` is logically
equivalent to `flattenObject(obj, depth).forEach(func)`.  Importantly, this
version never constructs the full array.  Its memory usage is O(depth) rather
than O(n) (where `n` is the number of flattened elements).

There's another difference between `flattenObject` and `flattenIter` that's
related to the special case where `depth === 0`.  In this case, `flattenObject`
omits the array wrapping `obj` (which is regrettable).


### pluck(obj, key)

Fetch nested property "key" from object "obj", traversing objects as needed.
For example, `pluck(obj, "foo.bar.baz")` is roughly equivalent to
`obj.foo.bar.baz`, except that:

1. If traversal fails, the resulting value is undefined, and no error is
   thrown.  For example, `pluck({}, "foo.bar")` is just undefined.
2. If "obj" has property "key" directly (without traversing), the
   corresponding property is returned.  For example,
   `pluck({ 'foo.bar': 1 }, 'foo.bar')` is 1, not undefined.  This is also
   true recursively, so `pluck({ 'a': { 'foo.bar': 1 } }, 'a.foo.bar')` is
   also 1, not undefined.


### randElt(array)

Returns an element from "array" selected uniformly at random.  If "array" is
empty, throws an Error.


### startsWith(str, prefix)

Returns true if the given string starts with the given prefix and false
otherwise.


### endsWith(str, suffix)

Returns true if the given string ends with the given suffix and false
otherwise.


### parseInteger(str, options)

Parses the contents of `str` (a string) as an integer. On success, the integer
value is returned (as a number). On failure, an error is **returned** describing
why parsing failed.

By default, leading and trailing whitespace characters are not allowed, nor are
trailing characters that are not part of the numeric representation. This
behaviour can be toggled by using the options below. The empty string (`''`) is
not considered valid input. If the return value cannot be precisely represented
as a number (i.e., is smaller than `Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER` or larger than
`Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`), an error is returned. Additionally, the string
`'-0'` will be parsed as the integer `0`, instead of as the IEEE floating point
value `-0`.

This function accepts both upper and lowercase characters for digits, similar to
`parseInt()`, `Number()`, and [strtol(3C)](https://illumos.org/man/3C/strtol).

The following may be specified in `options`:

Option             | Type    | Default | Meaning
------------------ | ------- | ------- | ---------------------------
base               | number  | 10      | numeric base (radix) to use, in the range 2 to 36
allowSign          | boolean | true    | whether to interpret any leading `+` (positive) and `-` (negative) characters
allowImprecise     | boolean | false   | whether to accept values that may have lost precision (past `MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` or below `MIN_SAFE_INTEGER`)
allowPrefix        | boolean | false   | whether to interpret the prefixes `0b` (base 2), `0o` (base 8), `0t` (base 10), or `0x` (base 16)
allowTrailing      | boolean | false   | whether to ignore trailing characters
trimWhitespace     | boolean | false   | whether to trim any leading or trailing whitespace/line terminators
leadingZeroIsOctal | boolean | false   | whether a leading zero indicates octal

Note that if `base` is unspecified, and `allowPrefix` or `leadingZeroIsOctal`
are, then the leading characters can change the default base from 10. If `base`
is explicitly specified and `allowPrefix` is true, then the prefix will only be
accepted if it matches the specified base. `base` and `leadingZeroIsOctal`
cannot be used together.

**Context:** It's tricky to parse integers with JavaScript's built-in facilities
for several reasons:

- `parseInt()` and `Number()` by default allow the base to be specified in the
  input string by a prefix (e.g., `0x` for hex).
- `parseInt()` allows trailing nonnumeric characters.
- `Number(str)` returns 0 when `str` is the empty string (`''`).
- Both functions return incorrect values when the input string represents a
  valid integer outside the range of integers that can be represented precisely.
  Specifically, `parseInt('9007199254740993')` returns 9007199254740992.
- Both functions always accept `-` and `+` signs before the digit.
- Some older JavaScript engines always interpret a leading 0 as indicating
  octal, which can be surprising when parsing input from users who expect a
  leading zero to be insignificant.

While each of these may be desirable in some contexts, there are also times when
none of them are wanted. `parseInteger()` grants greater control over what
input's permissible.

### iso8601(date)

Converts a Date object to an ISO8601 date string of the form
"YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.sssZ".  This format is not customizable.


### parseDateTime(str)

Parses a date expressed as a string, as either a number of milliseconds since
the epoch or any string format that Date accepts, giving preference to the
former where these two sets overlap (e.g., strings containing small numbers).


### hrtimeDiff(timeA, timeB)

Given two hrtime readings (as from Node's `process.hrtime()`), where timeA is
later than timeB, compute the difference and return that as an hrtime.  It is
illegal to invoke this for a pair of times where timeB is newer than timeA.

### hrtimeAdd(timeA, timeB)

Add two hrtime intervals (as from Node's `process.hrtime()`), returning a new
hrtime interval array.  This function does not modify either input argument.


### hrtimeAccum(timeA, timeB)

Add two hrtime intervals (as from Node's `process.hrtime()`), storing the
result in `timeA`.  This function overwrites (and returns) the first argument
passed in.


### hrtimeNanosec(timeA), hrtimeMicrosec(timeA), hrtimeMillisec(timeA)

This suite of functions converts a hrtime interval (as from Node's
`process.hrtime()`) into a scalar number of nanoseconds, microseconds or
milliseconds.  Results are truncated, as with `Math.floor()`.


### validateJsonObject(schema, object)

Uses JSON validation (via JSV) to validate the given object against the given
schema.  On success, returns null.  On failure, *returns* (does not throw) a
useful Error object.


### extraProperties(object, allowed)

Check an object for unexpected properties.  Accepts the object to check, and an
array of allowed property name strings.  If extra properties are detected, an
array of extra property names is returned.  If no properties other than those
in the allowed list are present on the object, the returned array will be of
zero length.

### mergeObjects(provided, overrides, defaults)

Merge properties from objects "provided", "overrides", and "defaults".  The
intended use case is for functions that accept named arguments in an "args"
object, but want to provide some default values and override other values.  In
that case, "provided" is what the caller specified, "overrides" are what the
function wants to override, and "defaults" contains default values.

The function starts with the values in "defaults", overrides them with the
values in "provided", and then overrides those with the values in "overrides".
For convenience, any of these objects may be falsey, in which case they will be
ignored.  The input objects are never modified, but properties in the returned
object are not deep-copied.

For example:

    mergeObjects(undefined, { 'objectMode': true }, { 'highWaterMark': 0 })

returns:

    { 'objectMode': true, 'highWaterMark': 0 }

For another example:

    mergeObjects(
        { 'highWaterMark': 16, 'objectMode': 7 }, /* from caller */
        { 'objectMode': true },                   /* overrides */
        { 'highWaterMark': 0 });                  /* default */

returns:

    { 'objectMode': true, 'highWaterMark': 16 }
